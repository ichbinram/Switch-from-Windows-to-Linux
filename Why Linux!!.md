# Why Linux?
- It is very light weight and barely requires any resources (you can even run it on a potato!).
- It is free, open source and more privacy oriented. That means, you can choose what you wish to share to linux (unlike windows, which doesn't give you a choice intuitively).
- Gives more control over how the user can allocate resources to the operating system.
- It can play games (Although few games refuse to run on it).
- It is by far the best environment for coding and programming.
- It gives you a lot of customization options, ranging from changing your desktop environment to using a custom kernel.
- There are a lot of distributions to choose from, so you are not stuck with one operating system for the rest of your life (You also can basically customize one distro to look like another). Which also means, distro-hopping is a thing.
- Geared more towards protuctive or power user.
- You can use one package manager, probably 2 to install all the softwares you need.

# Things you might miss out from Windows
- Maybe the UI. But honestly speaking, you could actually make your Linux install look exactly like windows or even Mac for that matter.
- The luxury of playing most of the games hassel free. By that I mean, you don't have to write any configuration files or mess with WINE or PROTON.
- Hot keys or few commands you learned on Windows.
- Features like Cortana, if you are into that kind of stuff.
- Adobe creative suite is not available on Linux, if your workflow revolves around this product, maybe you shouldn't switch to Linux. Or maybe change your workflow! :P
