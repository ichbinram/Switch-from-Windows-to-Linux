# Why Linux?
- It is very light weight and barely requires any resources (you can even run it on a potato!).
- It is free, open source and more privacy oriented. That means, you can choose what you wish to share to linux (unlike windows, which doesn't give you a choice intuitively).
- Gives more control over how the user can allocate resources to the operating system.
- It can play games (Although few games refuse to run on it).
- It is by far the best environment for coding and programming.
- It gives you a lot of customization options, ranging from changing your desktop environment to using a custom kernel.
- There are a lot of distribution to choose from, so you are not stuck with one operating system for the rest of your life (You also can basically customize one distro to look like another). Which also means, distro-hopping is a thing.
